"Can I give a tiny bit of money and will that even help?"
When you give small amounts even "nano" amounts, it can add up to something signifigant over time.
Inspire children with give goals. (Give early. Give often)

"I don't have any money to give"...
"Which organizations use my money to help others?"
"Where can I donate my money and make a difference?"
